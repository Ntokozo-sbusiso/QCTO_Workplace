    "\n",
    "#### The analysis aims to address several key research questions pertaining to vegetable price dynamics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Identify patterns of seasonal variation in vegetable prices.\n",
    "- Examine how seasonal trends affect pricing trends for different vegetable types.\n",
    "- Identify trends and patterns in vegetable prices over time through exploratory data analysis.\n",
    "- Explore seasonal variations in vegetable prices to understand their cyclical nature.\n",
    "- Provide actionable insights for stakeholders in the agricultural industry to support decision-making processes, enhance market efficiency, and improve economic outcomes.\n",

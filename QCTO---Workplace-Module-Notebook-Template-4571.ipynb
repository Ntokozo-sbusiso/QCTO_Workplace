    "#### The analysis aims to address several key research questions pertaining to vegetable price dynamics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Identify patterns of seasonal variation in vegetable prices.\n",
    "- Examine how seasonal trends affect pricing trends for different vegetable types.\n",
    "- Identify trends and patterns in vegetable prices over time through exploratory data analysis.\n",

    "#### Results\n",
    "\n",
    "- ARIMA: While ARIMA performed reasonably well, it showed a higher RMSE compared to the other models, indicating larger prediction errors. Its MAE also suggested that the model struggled to make precise predictions, especially during price fluctuations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- LSTM: The LSTM model demonstrated moderate performance, with an RMSE lower than ARIMA’s but still higher than XGBoost. The model captured some of the temporal patterns in the data, but it was not as accurate as expected for price prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "- XGBoost: Among the three models, XGBoost outperformed both ARIMA and LSTM. It showed the lowest RMSE, indicating the smallest prediction errors. Additionally, it consistently had a higher R² value, meaning it explained a greater portion of the variance in the price data. The MAE was also lower for XGBoost, indicating more accurate predictions on average.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusion:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Based on the RMSE, MAE, and R² metrics, XGBoost emerged as the best-performing model for vegetable price prediction in this case. Its ability to minimize prediction error and its strong performance across various evaluation metrics suggest it is the most reliable model for this forecasting task. Therefore, XGBoost was selected as the final model for deployment in predicting vegetable prices."

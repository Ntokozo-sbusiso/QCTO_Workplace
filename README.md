### Price Prediction Using ARIMA, XGBoost, and LSTM
1. Project Overview

   - This project aims to predict vegetable prices using three machine learning models: ARIMA, XGBoost, and LSTM.
   - The goal is to identify the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and R².

2. Features and Objectives

   - Time Series Analysis: Understand price trends and seasonality in the dataset.
   - Model Comparison: Evaluate and compare the performance of ARIMA, XGBoost, and LSTM models.
   - Forecasting: Provide accurate future price predictions to assist in decision-making.
3. Data

   - The dataset consists of vegetable price data over time, including features like:
        Date of observation.
        Price values for various vegetables (e.g., Tomato, Onion, Potato).
   - Preprocessing Steps:
        Handle missing values and outliers.
        Normalize data for LSTM.
        Feature engineering (e.g., time-based splitting and lag features).

4. Methodology

    ARIMA:
        Used for time series forecasting.
        Focused on capturing trends and seasonality in the data.

    XGBoost:
        A supervised learning model leveraging regression trees.
        Utilized lagged price features as inputs.

    LSTM:
        A deep learning model specialized in sequence data.
        Trained using a sliding window approach to forecast future prices.

    Evaluation Metrics:
        Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
        Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
        R-Squared (R²)

5. Results

    Performance Summary:
        Include a table summarizing RMSE, MAE, and R² for each model.
